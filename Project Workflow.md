# Excel-Bike-Sales-Project

## Workflow Steps

### 1. **Data Cleaning**
- **Remove Duplicates:** Ensure the dataset does not have any duplicate entries by using Excel's "Remove Duplicates" function.
- **Standardize Values:** Update inconsistent values:
  - Replace "M/F" under the "Gender" column with "Male/Female."
  - Replace "M/S" under the "Marital Status" column with "Married/Single."
- **Validate Data Types:** Verify that all columns are of the correct data types (e.g., numeric, text, date). Rectify mismatched types to ensure accuracy in analysis.

### 2. **Data Transformation**
- **Create Age Bracket Column:** Categorize the "Age" column into meaningful age groups (e.g., Young Adult, Mid-Adult, Pre-Retirement, Seniors) to simplify data analysis and improve visualization.

### 3. **Data Aggregation**
- **Build Pivot Tables:** Create pivot tables to summarize key metrics such as:
  - Average income by gender and marital status.
  - Number of bikes purchased by age group, commute distance, and region.
  - Customer segmentation by education level and purchase behavior.

### 4. **Data Visualization**
- **Generate Charts:** Create clear and visually appealing charts based on the pivot table insights, including:
  - Bar charts to display income differences by gender and marital status.
  - Line charts to track customer commute patterns and age group trends.
  - Comparative charts for purchased versus non-purchased categories.

### 5. **Dashboard Development**
- **Design Dashboard Layout:** Use a clean and professional layout to arrange the visualizations effectively.
- **Incorporate Interactivity:** Add slicers and filters for dynamic exploration of data by region, marital status, or age group.
- **Enhance Aesthetics:** Apply consistent color themes, labels, and formatting for improved readability and presentation.
- **Integrate Key Metrics:** Highlight important insights such as top-performing regions, customer demographics, and purchasing trends on the dashboard.

By following this workflow, the project ensures comprehensive data cleaning, insightful analysis, and a professional, user-friendly dashboard to showcase analytical capabilities.
